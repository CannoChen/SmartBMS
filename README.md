# SmartBMS APP

To run this app, please connect your mobile phone to your laptop by USB. Then, you must run the command below in the project file path:

```commonlisp
yarn install
```

Please wait a few minutes, you can run:

```commonlisp
yarn start
```



**Note:**

- The software does not fully integrate the `tensorflow` model yet. This function is in the experimental stage for now.
- You can see details about the integration of deep learning models into the app in `src/slice/TFLiteSlice.ts`. 
- In addition, we have added an untrained model under `public/my_tflite_model`.

**One more thing!!!!**

We will continue to improve this software, even though it is only an experimental version now. In the future we would like to develop a smart APP for industrial applications. If you have any questions, please contact 7231905009@stu.jiangnan.edu.cn.
